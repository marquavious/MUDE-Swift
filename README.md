# Hue Quick Start iOS Swift Port

This project is a port of the Objective-C Hue Quick Start App to Swift. Available here: https://github.com/PhilipsHue/PhilipsHueSDK-iOS-OSX

I've done this as a learning exercise of Swift as well as embracing storyboards.

Pull requests and Swift pointers totally welcome :-)

This should now be feature complete but probably has a bug or two as I haven't executed every code path.

Things I reckon might need some work:
* Swift optionals consistency
* Fix some of the fugly work arounds for Swift implementations of Objective-c
