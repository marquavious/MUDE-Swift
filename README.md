# MUDE-Swift


MÜDE is an application that uses Lyric Api’s and a bluemix api to match the philip hue color to certain songs.

we use json for lyric parsing and then use use blumixes tone analyzer to return the emotion values on the different songs.

From there we use the emotion algorithms to populate the Hue's with different colors....pretty cool Huh?

This is version 1.0 Beta and there are a couple bugs, but it is functional.

It is still in development and it will be shipped as soon as We get our hands on some more bulbs


**The app will crash if the rate limit of the searches is reached.
